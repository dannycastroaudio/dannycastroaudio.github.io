  <h1>ABOUT THIS SICKENING BAND</h1>
  <div>
	 <p> Born from the ashes of heartbreak, caffeine, and cat hair, My Chemical Cat prowls the moonlit alleys of the emo underworld, yowling songs of sorrow and slightly misplaced eyeliner. Rumored to have formed during a group cry in a Petco parking lot, this feline force of emotional turbulence has been clawing at the hearts of audiences ever since. Whether they’re serenading lost love, existential dread, or the eternal question of “who moved my black nail polish,” My Chemical Cat reminds us that it’s okay to feel — dramatically, loudly, and preferably in matching chokers. </p>

	  <h2> Band Members </h2>
	  <h3> Meet Dapper Danny </h3>
		  <p> Dapper Danny was born in the back of a thrift store dressing room wearing a velvet blazer and holding a single tear-shaped crystal. Raised on equal parts vintage romance and vegan angst, Danny adds that touch of tortured elegance to My Chemical Cat. His main inspirations include unrequited love, overcast weather, and the idea of “being misunderstood, but like, fashionably.” He once wrote a 12-minute ballad about a cat who never texted back. It charted in three alternative dimensions</p>
		  
	  <h3>Meet Careful Chloe</h3>
	  <p>Careful Chloe hails from the delicate border between anxiety and caffeine addiction. Once described as “a walking caution sign wrapped in lace,” she brings both emotional depth and several backup inhalers to every performance. Her careful nature means she triple-checks every chord, lyric, and existential decision before committing — but when she finally hits the stage, she explodes like a glitter bomb of pent-up feelings. Her cat, Mister Whiskerstein, serves as her muse, therapist, and occasional stand-in bassist.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Meet Amazing Alicia</h3>
	    <p>Emerging from the neon-lit aisles of a long-forgotten Hot Topic deep in the jungles of the internet, Amazing Alicia is the band’s fierce frontwoman and occasional customer service representative. She first discovered her voice while singing along to her cat’s existential meows at 3 a.m. and hasn’t stopped since. Known for her power stance and eyeliner sharper than a samurai sword, Alicia claims her greatest influences are heartbreak, lightning storms, and Prime shipping. She once ordered her own sense of purpose online — it’s still in transit.</p>
	  <h3>Meet Jubilant Jihae</h3>
	  <p> Despite her name, Jubilant Jihae is the band’s emotional paradox — smiling through every breakdown and headbanging with poetic despair. She learned to play drums using the broken dreams of her past bands, which she repurposed into an award-winning percussion setup. Jihae believes rhythm is the heartbeat of sadness — preferably played at 200 BPM. Offstage, she runs a small but thriving side business making scented candles named after bad decisions, such as Eyeliner in the Rain and Texts You Shouldn’t Have Sent. </p>
